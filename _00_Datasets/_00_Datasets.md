# _00_Datasets

Here the datasets for the software are stored.

Available are the datasets from Quiroga2020:
https://figshare.le.ac.uk/articles/dataset/Simulated_dataset/11897595

There are four different datasets with multiple level of noise:
- Easy1: 005-040
- Easy2: 005-020 + 015 has separate Burst and Drift variants
- Difficult1: 005-020
- Difficult2: 005-020

These are simulated datasets saved as Matlab Files, which have 
Ground Truth labels, so there is no need to do filtering 
and spike detection.
