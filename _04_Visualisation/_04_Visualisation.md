# _04_Visualisation

### Visualisation
- implement graphs using matplotlib for
  - printing a spike waveform
  - original and reconstructed Spike on same scale
  - 2D feature spaces with labels and cluster centers
  - loss curves
  - contingency matrix
- methods for
  - computing cluster centers
  - computing cluster distances 
  - matching true labels with clustered labels
  - computing accuracy 

### Tables
- extracts information from log files of experiments
  - for example: accuracy, punishment coefficients, variant names, minimal cluster distances
- implement graphs using matplotlib, seaborn for
  - creating accuracy heatmap for variant dataset combination
  - accuracy bar graphs for every variant
  - violent graphs specified on dataset or variant
- creating tables for
  - listing punishment coefficients
  - listing minimal cluster distances

### Grid Search Table
- Grid Search Table is like Tables for visualising Grid Search Experiments
  - accuracy heatmap with adjusted dimensions and x-axis (pc)
  - extracts punishment coefficients with the highest accuracy for a dataset
